# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Set up an SQL environment. Use Postgres as my RDMS and PgAdminIII as my playform. Also, finished a leetCode problem 23. Merge K sorted List using Java.

**Thoughts:** SQL is pretty cool, I have more interest in it now. 

**Link to work:** <None. Only screen shot>
