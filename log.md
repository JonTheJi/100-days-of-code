# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Set up an SQL environment. Using Postgres as my RDMS and PgAdminIII as my platform. Also, finished leetCode problem 23. Merge K sorted List using Java.

**Thoughts:** SQL is pretty cool, I have more interest in it now.

### Day 2: September 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about SQL such as how to use the SELECT command(function). Also, finished leetCode problem 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array using java. (Took me super long...)

**Thoughts:** Remember index out of bound problem when using recursion to modify the mid *index. Make sure your base case cover it.

### Day 3: September 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished leetCode problem 81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II (I learned some strategy from this question!)

**Thoughts:** Use (condition) and !(condition) for Binary search so you can narrow down the possibilities that make your code crash (know what cause errors)
