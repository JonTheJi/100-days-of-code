### Day 1: September 24, 2018

### Day 3: September 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished leetCode problem 81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II (I learned some strategy from this question!)

**Thoughts:** Use (condition) and !(condition) for Binary search so you can narrow down the possibilities that make your code crash (know what cause errors)
